# locust_pres
Locust examples and support scripts.

# Presentation
The presentation uses the reveal.js presentation framework, and is available as `locust_presentation.html`. A PDF version
is also provided as Performance_Testing_with_Python_and_Locust.pdf, although the PDF
conversion loses some of the reveal.js features.

# Locust Files
Example locust files are found in the `locust_demo` directory. These all work
against the sample 'Flaskr' application that's available in the `sample_app` directory. 

# Sample app
The `sample_app` is essentially a copy of the Flaskr app that comes bundled with
the flask microframework. Launch instructions can be found in the README in that directory.
 
# Sample deployment
The `sample_deploy` directory contains a very simple helm deployment. Further instructions
can be found in the README in that directory.
